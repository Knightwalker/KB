#Presentation
Slide 2  -> from "Iterate over Object Keys" to "Object iteration"
Slide 9  -> from "Use for-in to loop through the keys:" to "Use for-in loop to iterate over the object properties by key:"
         -> fixed the showcased example to better illustrate a for-in loop according to the javascript official documentation
Slide 11 -> remade the slide to demonstrate a for-in loop
Slide 24 -> solution does not work for problem "4. Convert to JSON", because of tiny syntax error. Fixed the presentation, but it would be best to fix the judge test.
         -> expect {"name":"George","lastName":"Jones","hairColor":"Brown"}
         -> actual {"firstName":"George","lastName":"Jones","hairColor":"Brown"}

(Stuff I think that needs to be checked)
04. Movies - I think that this exercise needs to be reworked.
- The input/output needs to demonstrate the 2 variants of the output, not just 1.
- Also the way judge expects the output is tricky. The JSON stringified object has differently rearranged properties in the output
05. Inventory - The name of the exercise should be renamed to better reflect a collection of heroes.
