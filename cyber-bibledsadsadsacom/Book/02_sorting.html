What is a Sorting Algorithm?
- An algorithm that rearranges elements in a list
- Elements must be comparable

Conditions:
- The input is a sequence / list of elements.
- The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired total order).
- The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Classification:
Sorting algorithms are often classified by:
- Computational complexity (worst, average and best behavior).
- Memory usage (and use of other computer resources).

Stability of Sorting
- Stable sort algorithms maintain the order of equal elements in the same way that they appear in the input.
- Unstable sort algorithms rearrange equal elements in unpredictable order.
